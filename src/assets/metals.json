It does let a character see further through the mists, and more clearly than any ordinary human, even in dim light. So long as the character has at least a little ambient illumination — generally, anywhere but underground, in a sealed room, or in a dense forest on a cloudy night — he or she can see as well as an ordinary person during the day. \n Because all senses are enhanced equally, a character burning or flaring Tin is vulnerable to loud noises, sudden bright lights, and extremely strong smells.

While burning Iron, a character sees bright, transparent blue lines leading from his or her center of mass and leading out to all sources of metal within range; the further away an object is from the character, the fainter the blue lines. The character may Pull on any metal objects sensed in this fashion, and this process is commonly called “Ironpulling.” By varying the strength and speed of an Ironpull, a character may affect objects of various sizes, and also control their velocity. A skilled Pull can drag a coin slowly across a surface or hurl a metal urn at speeds approaching that of an arrow.\n There are several limitations to this ability. First, objects are Pulled directly towards the character’s center of mass, which is good when drawing a weapon to hand but not as helpful when others are blocking the character’s line of sight to it. Strategic Pullers might use this to their advantage, Pulling a weapon (or another object) that’s situated on the other side of an opponent, turning it into a ranged weapon. This is great until the character misses, at which point he or she becomes a target of the very same missile. Many Ironpullers carry wooden shields for this very reason. \n Additionally, the weight an Allomancer can move using Iron depends upon his or her own — Pulling an object that weighs as much as the character results in a pointless tug of war, while Pulling something heavier, or something anchored down in some fashion that would support the character’s weight, moves the character toward the object instead. Thus, Pulling the lock of a sturdy door would draw the character toward the door, unless the surrounding wall were somehow unstable enough that it wouldn’t support the character’s weight. \n Allomancers often anchor themselves by Pulling on a second larger object, or increasing their weight. Creative characters use this to maneuver, Pulling themselves up toward anchored objects and using others to guide their trajectories through the air. Careful “Pulling” can even work like relaxing a muscle, letting the character slowly drop from a metal fixture at the top of a high structure or sliding down a steep incline topped with an anchored metal object. Burning Iron can even let a character hover in midair below a sufficiently secured mooring, like a metal chain holding up a large chandelier, or the metal binding around a wooden rafter. \n One last restriction: virtually no Allomancer can Pull on metal that’s inside a person, or that’s driven through a body, like metal earrings or Hemalurgic spikes. The only exceptions are through Allomantic enhancements, as provided by Duralumin or Nicrosil",
                "rules": "While burning Iron, you automatically detect and may Pull either one or all metal objects within 100 paces (Medium Range). This distinction is important — you may not choose to Pull more than one object unless you Pull all of them, or you have the Multiple Targets Stunt (see page 306).\nIf a Pulled object is smaller or lighter than you, it’s drawn toward you; otherwise, you’re Pulled towards it. In both cases you can control velocity, up to a maximum speed of approximately 100 mph. Generally, Ironpulling requires no roll unless there’s a compelling reason the story might be enhanced with failure (the Narrator always makes this call, as he or she has the best view of all story implications). When a roll is required, it’s made with your Iron rating. \nA common use of Ironpulling is to attack with loose metal objects behind an enemy. When you make such an attack, you roll with your Iron rating and apply the other rules listed here: \n Pulling an object held or worn by another character is a Contest between your Iron and the target’s Physique. Battling for a metal object with another Allomancer is also a Contest, pitting your Iron vs. his or her Iron. In both cases, success drags the object away from the target (if it’s held) or sends the target sprawling (if the object is worn) ",

Tapping weight increases the density and durability of the character’s body, letting him or her more easily withstand falls and similar stresses. Tapping extreme weight can let a character crush obstacles or break through floors. \n This versatility makes Iron one of the few metals that’s as useful when storing as when tapping.",
                "store": "When storing, your body weight drops by roughly 10% per charge currently being stored. As usual, you cannot store more of something than you have, so this means that the maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Iron rating or 9 (reducing your weight by roughly 90%), whichever is lower.\n Also while storing, it’s easier to jump and climb, and you suffer less damage from falls. For every two charges being stored, you gain one die with Physique rolls to jump or climb, and damage from falling drops by 1 (i.e. when storing four charges of weight, you gain two dice with these rolls and suffer 2 less damage from falls). However, other characters gain the same number of dice when attempting to grapple or throw you, or for any other activity that pits their weight against yours.\nYou may only store your own weight in an ironmind; the weight of any objects you carry or wear may never be stored, and in fact if their combined weight is ever greater than yours, you become pinned and may not move.",

There is no upper limit to the amount of weight you may gain in this way, but cautious Feruchemists keep in mind that weak and thin surfaces can easily give way if they go too far... \nJumping and climbing are also affected by tapping. For every two charges tapped, you lose one die with Physique rolls to jump or climb, and opponents lose one die with rolls to grapple or throw you, or for any other activity that pits their weight against yours. Thus, tapping ten charges reduces your pool by 5 dice when jumping or climbing, and your opponents’ pools by the same amount when grappling or throwing you, or performing similar actions. \n Characters often increase their weight with Iron to make themselves an anchor when Ironpulling or Steelpushing.",
